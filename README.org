* What this:
I made a bunch of toy directories while writing Mintbase's core contracts to
document bugs and/or to try out complex features before implementing them for
realz.

Most of note is =near-template=, which you may want to clone for your dumb toy
directories too. =near_cross_n_sim_ex= may also be of interest, as it documents
the setup of a Rust monorepo setup with multiple contracts that interface with
one another.

If you have questions about these directories (perhaps because you're running
into a parallel confusion/issue), feel free to drop me an issue.
